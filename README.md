## About this repository
This repository contains the code that is used to control/style the OutSystems UI patterns.
The code is written in TypeScriptðŸ–¤ and in SCSS, and you branch it and PR your changes/proposals!

### What tools should you use?
We highly recommend the usage of the following tools:
* [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* With these extensions:
  * Document This
  * ESLint
  * Prettier - Code formatter

### How to change this code?
1. Create a branch based in the branch **master** (lastest & greatest release)
2. Open your Visual Code in your branch
3. Run the following command in Visual Code terminal: `npm run setup` (this will install all the dependencies that you need and compile the code)
4. Do your magic! :)
5. **Document your code** (with the extension "Document This", start typing `/**` and the extension will give you a good starting point
6. Compile and fix errors and warnings (in Visual Code terminal: `npm run build`)
7. Check if the code format is following our conventions (in Visual Code terminal: `npm run lint`)
7.1 Some of the conventions can be fixed automatically by lint (in Visual Code terminal: `npm run lintfix`)
7.2 Although the script above execute the prettier conventions, you may want to run it over all project files (in Visual Code terminal: `npm run prettier`)
8. Fix all errors & warnings! :)
9. Create a PR, describing what was the (mis)behavior, what you changed and please provide a sample 

### How to add new feature/fix?
  * A new branch from **master** should be created.
  * If possible the branch should be kept updated with the master branch.
  * If possible unnecessary commit messages should be omitted.
