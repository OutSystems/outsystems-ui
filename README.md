### Where can you find the component?

The OutSystems UI component, like all components, can be found in [OutSystems forge](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/1385/outsystems-ui).

### Where can you find documentation?

The documentation can be found in the [OutSystems UI website](https://outsystemsui.outsystems.com/outsystemsuiwebsite/) and in [OutSystems product documentation](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Developing_an_Application/Design_UI/Patterns).

We also use the [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) to automatically generate documentation. TypeDoc converts comments in TypeScript source code into rendered HTML documentation, alongside UML diagrams for each class and Interface.
