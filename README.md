## About this repository
This repository contains the code that enable the usage of an external provider ([wijmo](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/)), to create grids in OutSystems applications with the least possible effort.
The code is written in TypeScriptðŸ–¤, and you branch it and PR your changes/proposals!

### What tools should you use?
We highly recommend the usage of the following tools:
* [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* With these extensions:
  * Document This
  * ESLint
  * Prettier - Code formatter

### How to use change this code?
1. Create a branch based in the branch **master** (lastest & greatest release)
2. Open your Visual Code in your branch
3. Run the following command in Visual Code terminal: `npm run setup` (this will install all the dependencies that you need and compile the code)
4. Do your magic! :)
5. **Document your code** (with the extension "Document This", start typing `/**` and the extension will give you a good starting point
6. Compile and fix errors and warnings (in Visual Code terminal: `npm run build`)
7. Check if the code format is following our conventions (in Visual Code terminal: `npm run lint`)
7.1 Some of the conventions can be fixed automatically by lint (in Visual Code terminal: `npm run lintfix`)
7.2 Although the script above execute the prettier conventions, you may want to run it over all project files (in Visual Code terminal: `npm run prettier`)
8. Fix all errors & warnings! :)
9. Create a PR, describing what was the (mis)behavior, what you changed and please provide a sample 

### How to add new feature/fix?
  * A new branch from **master** should be created.
  * If possible the branch should be kept updated with the master branch.
  * If possible unnecessary commit messages should be omitted.

### How to do a Pull Request?
After completing your changes, and testing, please proceed with submitting a Pull Request.

To be accepted, a Pull Request needs to:

1. **Fulfill the following requirements**
    * Needs to compile without errors
    * Needs to follow the code style rules (without warnings and errors)
    * Needs to be approved by 2 team members (owners of the repo)
    * The Pull Request template, should be filled up by the Pull Requestor:
      * Provide a short description
      * A link to a sample page showing the fixed behavior or the new feature
      * What was happening?
      * What was done?
      * Tests steps
      * Screenshots
      * Checklist

2. **Follow best practices**
    * The submitted code should be well documented (e.g. comments).
