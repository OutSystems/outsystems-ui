-   With these extensions:
    -   Document This
    -   ESLint
    -   Prettier - Code formatter

### How to change this code?

<ol>
  <li>Create a branch based in the branch <strong>master</strong> (lastest & greatest release)</li>
  <li>Open your Visual Code in your branch</li>
  <li>Run the following command in Visual Code terminal: <code>npm run setup</code> (this will install all the dependencies that you need and compile the code)</li>
  <li>Do your magic! :)</li>
  <li><strong>Document your code</strong> (with the extension "Document This", start typing <code>/**</code> and the extension will give you a good starting point</li>
  <li>Compile and fix errors and warnings (in Visual Code terminal: <code>npm run build</code>)</li>
  <li>
    Check if the code format is following our conventions (in Visual Code terminal: <code>npm run lint</code>)
    <ol>
      <li>Some of the conventions can be fixed automatically by lint (in Visual Code terminal: <code>npm run lintfix</code>)</li>
      <li>Although the script above execute the prettier conventions, you may want to run it over all project files (in Visual Code terminal: <code>npm run prettier</code>)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Fix all errors & warnings! :)</li>
  <li>Create a PR, describing what was the (mis)behavior, what you changed and please provide a sample </li>
</ol>

### How to add new feature/fix?

-   A new branch from **master** should be created.
-   If possible the branch should be kept updated with the master branch.
-   If possible unnecessary commit messages should be omitted.

### How to create a New Pattern structure?

  <ol>
    <li>Create a branch based in the branch <strong>master</strong> (lastest & greatest release)</li>
    <li>Run the following command in Visual Code terminal: <code>npm run create-pattern</code></li>
    <li>
      Answer to the following questions:
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Pattern Name?</strong> - <i>The name new pattern should have;</i></li>
        <li><strong>Provider Name?</strong> - <i>If/When pattern have an external provider/library. An abstract layer will be added to the Pattern.</i></li>
        <li><strong>Mode?</strong> - <i>If/When based on same provider, you will have multiple patterns like <strong>DatePicker</strong> that has <strong>Flatpickr</strong> as a provider and <strong>SingleDate</strong> and <strong>RangeDate</strong> as <strong>DatePicker</strong> modes; An abstract layer will be added to the Provider as well.</i></li>
        <li><strong>Custom destination Folder?</strong> - <i>If you do not provide a folder name here all the pattern files (if already exist) <strong>will be overwritten</strong>, this way you prevent that by creating a new folder where all the files will be automagically added.</i></li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li>Do your magic! :)<br><i>As mentioned above, all the nedded files (based in your answers) will be automagically created and added to right places.</i></li>
  </ol>

### How to generate Documentation?

We use the [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) to automatically generate documentation. TypeDoc converts comments in TypeScript source code into rendered HTML documentation, alongside UML diagrams for each class and Interface.

For the UML diagrams to be generated, some extra installations are required in your system:

-   [JAVA](https://www.java.com/en/) (latest version)
-   [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) (latest version)

Finally, you just need to run the command (in Visual Code terminal): <code>npm run docs</code>!
