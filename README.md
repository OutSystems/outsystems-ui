### Where can you find the component?

The OutSystems UI component, like all components, can be found in [OutSystems forge](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/1385/outsystems-ui).

### Where can you find documentation?

The documentation can be found in the [OutSystems UI website](https://outsystemsui.outsystems.com/outsystemsuiwebsite/) and in [OutSystems product documentation](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Developing_an_Application/Design_UI/Patterns).

We also use the [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) to automatically generate documentation. TypeDoc converts comments in TypeScript source code into rendered HTML documentation, alongside UML diagrams for each class and Interface.

Take a look at it, at [OutSystemsUI Framework Documentation](https://outsystems-ui-docs.github.io/).

-   With these extensions:
    -   Document This
    -   ESLint
    -   Prettier - Code formatter
-   [Node v12.0+](https://nodejs.org/en)

### How to change this code?

<ol>
  <li>Do a Repository <strong>Fork</strong></li>
  <li>Create a branch based in the branch <strong>master</strong> (latest & greatest release) - branch master is <strong>dev</strong></li>
  <li>Open your branch Code in Visual Studio Code</li>
  <li>Run the following command in Visual Studio Code terminal: <code>npm run setup</code> (this will install all the dependencies that you need to compile the code)</li>
  <li>Do your magic! 😎</li>
  <li><strong>Document your code</strong> (with the extension "Document This", start typing <code>/**</code> and the extension will give you a good starting point</li>
  <li>Compile and fix errors and warnings (in Visual Studio Code terminal: <code>npm run build</code>)</li>
  <li>
    Check if the code format is following our conventions (in Visual Studio Code terminal: <code>npm run lint</code>)
    <ol>
      <li>Some of the conventions can be fixed automatically by lint (in Visual Studio Code terminal: <code>npm run lintfix</code>)</li>
      <li>Although the script above executes the prettier conventions, you may want to run it over all project files (in Visual Studio Code terminal: <code>npm run prettier</code>)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Fix all errors & warnings! ✅</li>
  <li>Kept the branch updated with the master branch and also synchronized with the upstream <strong>master</strong></li>
  <li>Create a PR, describing what was the (mis)behavior, and what you changed and please provide a sample </li>
</ol>
